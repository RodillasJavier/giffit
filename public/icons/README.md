# Extension Icons

This directory should contain the following icon files:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (for extension toolbar)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (for extension management page)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (for Chrome Web Store)

## Design Suggestions

Consider using a design that represents:
- A GIF icon or animation symbol
- YouTube's play button combined with a GIF/camera icon
- Color scheme that stands out but fits YouTube's aesthetic

## Temporary Placeholder

For development purposes, you can use any PNG files with the correct dimensions.
